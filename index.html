            Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations 
            like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a 
            developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to 
            fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.

            A console application is a computer program designed to be used via a text-only computer text terminal. Different consoles are programmed to accept different languages. The text editor is integrated in the console. In HTML you were more concerned with just displaying markup and text, so the editor was mentioned frequently.

            In JavaScript it is more complicated because you are programming decisions so the console is much more advanced and there are more references to the console. Of course programmers use different terminology than designers. When you use HTML and CSS you are more of a designer than programmer because you are doing mostly presentation. JavaScript is all about programming.
